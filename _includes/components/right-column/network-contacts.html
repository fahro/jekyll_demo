    Our Member Centers tell us that the most valuable part of being an OCCRP Member is
    the network itself. We collaborate on stories, support one another when we get into
    sticky situations, and share information and best practices. Through our meetings,
    conferences, trainings and events you will meet others doing similar work in
    different regions. You will get the chance to speak with experts on various topics
    and meet key donors.
