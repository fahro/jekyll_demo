                                    Our editors help journalists across the OCCRP network turn extremely complicated
                                    investigations into stories that readers around the world can understand, share, and
                                    act upon. We also coordinate large cross-border investigations, bringing together
                                    different journalists and member centers and ensuring that project members are
                                    equipped with the right technology, data, and security tools. All journalists in the
                                    OCCRP network are invited to pitch stories to our core editorial team in Sarajevo,
                                    which provides feedback and editorial support both pre- and post-publication. Our
                                    daily news team also produces English-language news coverage of organized crime,
                                    corruption, and issues facing journalists worldwide, while our engagement section
