                                    Our editors help journalists across the OCCRP network turn extremely complicated
                                    investigations into stories that readers around the world can understand, share, and
                                    act upon. We also coordinate large cross-border investigations, bringing together
                                    different journalists and member centers and ensuring that project members are
                                    equipped with the right technology, data, and security tools. All journalists in the
                                    OCCRP network are invited to pitch stories to our core editorial team in Sarajevo,
                                    which provides feedback and editorial support both pre- and post-publication. Our
                                    daily news team also produces English-language news coverage of organized crime,
                                    corruption, and issues facing journalists worldwide, while our engagement section
                                    amplifies the work of our member centers.

                                    ID is an OCCRP service that helps investigative journalists within the network
                                    conduct research quickly and effectively. A team of researchers is on hand to track
                                    down people, companies, and assets — like ships and planes — anywhere in the world.
                                    They are equipped with access to a number of commercial search engines and
                                    databases, as well as the experience to make effective use of dozens of publicly
                                    available, but little-known, open sources. With the support of a bespoke ticketing
                                    system to shorten the lead time from story inception to publication, the research
                                    team helps OCCRP members break new ground in investigative journalism.
